# What is a Digital Public Good?

*Digital Public Goods include open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to the DPG Standard and are of high relevance for attainment of the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).*

**A Digital Public Good must overall satisfy the DPG Standard with 9 key indicators** ([more details on the indicators here](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/blob/main/standard-questions.md)):
1. Advance the SDGs; 
2. Be Open Source (obtain an OS license); 
3. Do No Harm; 
4. Use of Approved Open Licenses 
5. Clear Ownership 
6. Platform Independence 
7. Documentation 
8. Mechanism for Extracting Data 
9. Adherence to Privacy and Applicable Laws 
10. Adherence to Standards & Best Practices 
11. Do No Harm 

The DPG Standard and the DPG Registry is essential to a successful DPGA country engagement pilot, as the intention of a pilot from the Digital Public Good Alliance side will be to a) fine tune future country engagement activities and b) testing the DPG Standard and DPG Registry in action. These concepts are described in more detail below.  

You can also have the startup take this [eligibility questionnaire](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/eligibility/) to see if they are ready for nomination yet. 

### The Digital Public Goods Standard ([DPG Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/))

This standard establishes a baseline of alignment with the definition (above) which must be met in order to be considered a digital public good by the DPGA and broader community. **The DPG Standard is a list of the 9 indicators** and requirements that must be met in order for a nominated software, data, AI model, standard and/or content (described in the standard below as the “project”) to be considered a digital public good. 

### The Digital Public Goods Registry ([DPG Registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/)) 

This registry houses proposed digital public goods that have either been nominated directly or have been pulled together from partnership databases.  Once a nominated digital public good has been verified against the DPG Standard, it is considered a digital public good and labeled as such in the registry. 

Therefore, the registry is an important starting point to see if there is already an existing DPG (or startup) that is similar in nature already, to either reuse for the particular problem the startup is trying to solve for.

On the Digital Public Goods Registry, you can use the data explorer to filter by: 

1. **Status:** to see nominated projects vs. DPGs;
2. **Type:** Software, Content, Data, Standard; or 
3. **Sustainable Development Goal**. 

### How does a startup or project become a Digital Public Good?

Anyone can [submit a DPG nomination](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/nominate), but we HIGHLY recommend the project owner submitting, as they have accessible resources to documentation and information about the project.

**DPG Nomination Process** : Before nominating a DPG, check to see if there is already an existing Digital Public Good that may offer a similar solution in the [DPG Registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/).

**What if I have questions about a project on the registry?**
If you have a question about a project on the registry, including if you have identified a DPG nominee as promising for potential pathfinding piloting and need to ensure that it is swiftly assessed against the DPG Standard, please reach out to nominations@digitalpublicgoods.net. 

**What if a project is missing from the registry?**
Projects can be added as nominees to the DPG Registry at any time via an open process. You can [You can nominate a DPG here.](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/nominate). 

Please check the [submission guide](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/submission-guide) in advance to know what information will be requested. If you do not have all of the information about a project you may still submit it. Please provide as much information as possible. Projects with more complete information will move more quickly through the vetting process.
