# How can open source business models make money? (Myths, Opportunities, Challenges)

## Before considering if it is a DPG, we have to understand, what is considered open source?

A Digital Public Good must meet the standard indicator of operating on an open source license, therefore the startup or a part of the business model must be open source. We will go in depth about the technicalities of open source in this guide. On a high level, here’s what you need to know.

**Open source is a way to license software, hardware, and content in a way that allows them to be continuously improved, modified and redistributed by any purpose commercially.**  Some companies see open source as marketing, as a community, free organic marketing - adoption mechanism.

### **Open source is also…**

**Method** | **Movement** |**Culture**
----------|--------------|------------
To develop and distribute software and a set of best practices to make software and build teams that make software | Movement based on ideals and philosophy beyond only code | Collection of people, values, and ideas that take the form of software projects and communities 

### What are the challenges that startups typically face?
- **Cost:** Many startup struggle to develop sustainable cost structure.  Market competitiveness now requires significant investment in R&D, testing, and product development, which includes surveying, research, coding and more, all of which many companies have minimal budgets for. 
- **Funding:** Especially in developing and emerging market, it is often difficult to gain access to seed funding and risk financing. 
- **Copyright:**  It is becoming increasingly difficult to protect IP, so businesses that create and capture their entirely from a proprietary product are being threatened by competition. 
- **Diversity:** More companies are discovering the importance of having diverse teams, which can add a rich range of perspectives that can widen a company's reach and enrich successful product development.  As such, companies with very homogenous teams are falling behind.

### What are some myths and misconceptions that exist surrounding open source?

**Myth #1:** I've heard that it's **impossible to make money in open source** because anyone can just take your code and market it themselves | **Myth #2:**  I've heard that **open source software is susceptible to feeling disjointed** because there so many people with different coding style working on the project. | **Myth #3:** I've encountered so many OS repositories that don't seem to be actively maintained.  Is it true that the **majority of open source projects are abandoned?*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_**Truth:**_ Despite the fact that your code or hardware design is freely available, there are a number of businesses that are profitable, have received investment, and have been acquired and gone public with open source solutions. | _**Truth:**_ It's true that disjointed software can happen, and that it can set a project back or even run it into the ground.  However, following coding best practices and ensuring extensive documentation surrounding project and coding guidelines and protocols can, along with good project communication and a common, well-articulated vision, help to ensure that the software remains a unified project. | _**Truth:**_ Approximately 98% are only modified in the year after they are created and are never touched again.  However, this may be tempered by the fact that about 1/2 of the active projects have only one contributor and close to 90% have 5 or fewer.  This indicates many projects are non-professional in nature.

_**How do you continue to make OS projects sustainable:**_
- Make sure developers use the product, so they have stake in making it better 
- Have a clearly defined vision that everyone can agree on 
- Get enough people onto the project such that no one developer is overwhelmed with feature requests or bugs, but not too many people such that it is hard to juggle the contributors and stick to a singular vision. 

## Startup Benefits of Going Open Source

1. **Community:**  Get feedback on what works and what doesn't.  Has a direct line that has feedback to integrate back.  Have collaborators working on their product before they join the company.  Promoting work through public events: government officials, researchers and received government grants to finance the launch of the platform to the public. 

2. **User Growth:**  The use cost is typically lower than with proprietary equivalents.  As software use cost < proprietary software use cost.  This greatly expands access among those who do not have desire to pay: 
    - _**Expanded access means customer goodwill**_
    - _**Prevents vendor lock-in:**_  They may have information that is stored in file only compatible with that software.  If users need a feature or customization:
        - Difficult or impossible to convince proprietary vendor
        - With open source, customers can create their own customizations or request help from the community 
        - Direct and transparent user feedback

3. **Talent Acquisition:** Community-oriented nature of open source
    - Prior knowledge of the most talented candidates 
    - Opportunity to review freely available OS code created by candidates 
    - Opportunity for candidates to review your products as well 
    - Open source is a powerful recruiting 
        - Their open source programming, FB open source software program positively contributed to working at FB 
        - Onboarding is easier, staff is already familiar
    - High licensing fees:  with open source, you can pick it up and learn a new technology, creates well-rounded developers to understand the whole developer stack.  It is also important to use OS, but what to do with that. 
    - Cost-effectiveness and Optimization
    - Wide range of high-quality solutions in OS repositories 
    - Account management solutions available in OS repositories (use OpenSSL toolkit for password protection) 
    - Community standards mean high readability in OS code (must be clean and must be understood for all developers) 
    - You could save as much as it costs to develop the software you need to build on top of.  Due to high costs of proprietary software development (mostly from developer salaries and company infrastructure), it can actually save you quite a bit of money to use an open source base.  For example, financial tech firm Pendo Systems saved $500K by using an open source calculation engine instead of developing their own proprietary version.

## Challenges of Open Source Strategy

1. **Community Maintenance:**  Network effect, which is a product or service is better when there is a larger community using it.  If the problem is not a common one, or pioneering something completely new, it's hard to find people onboard.  It takes a long time to market, especially in places that open source isn't popular in your area. 
    - More information is provided in Community Building section of this guide
    - Corporate communities: How to contribute from outside your team, in meetings you can have all the same team members in one room, and other meetings in other rooms, really need to think of flattening the teams of all developers and giving same level of involvement in participatory meetings. 

2. **Customer Support:**  Some OSS doesn't have documentation.  As with a licensed proprietary software, sometimes it stops being maintained altogether.  Whether to use OSS yourself and base your market strategy off it, it's best to think:
    - Ensure that there are active forums devoted to the software 
    - Ensure that you can provide continuous user support (don't want to grow user base, and stop supporting them if you move on). 
    - Single financial backer of communities:  sometimes the communities focus on technical completeness and neglect technical documentation.   Using SaaS strategy to establish an infrastructure for customer support. 

3. **Development costs:** Building and maintenance costs for OS usually equal to those of proprietary software.  Diverse sources of funding available, especially for OS products for humanitarian purposes. 
    - How could I convince an investor that my company, which would be giving software away for free, has any value worth investing in?
        - Convince people that it's not as risky as people think, it's the expertise and the know how is more important than the open source code.  
        - It's the collaboration in the work in development 
        - Great feedback you wouldn't know if it wasn't open source

4. **Increased Complexity:** with many contributors than just one person/team can build, it may be difficult for 1 person to understand all the pieces of it.
    - Intimidating because of the complexity may make group collaboration more difficult
    - Need to invest a lot of time and effort to learn the technology first, and learning how to code, use, and then contribute to it.
    - Not everybody has the same understanding of technology.
