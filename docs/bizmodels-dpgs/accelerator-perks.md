# Accelerator Perks of Supporting DPGs

When a startup creates a digital public good, it opens avenues for scaling a startup in the following ways:

1. **Create a global network:** UNICEF, DPGA, DPGA roadmap members work with startup ecosystems, government agencies and field experts to connect your startups to stakeholders who can potentially support the startup's solution to be recognized as a DPG.  This also can include a wider contribution from the IT community which is important for the active open source aspect. The DPG that your accelerator supports could potentially be considered or included in reccommendations made to governments and UN agencies seeking open source solutions by UNICEF or the DPGA.  Your accelerator can also make global network connections from DPGA members.

2. **Potential relevence to the DPGA's communities of practice:**  The DPGA convenes communities of practice (CoP) to bring together experts from different organizations to align on definitions, processes and collectively identify, assess and advance the use of DPGs that can help meet critical needs relevent to the sustainable development goals. CoPs are a means of leveraging years of experience from individuals working in relevant sectors that have gained invaluable insights into implementation processes and development needs. The DPGA convenes communities of practice in areas such as climate change adaptation, financial inclusion, and health.

3. **The potential scale and growth of the startup participating in your programme:** The startups you support in your accelerator program can potentially be adapted and solve challenges in other countries, giving it the geographic scale and growth quicker than a proprietary business. If the startup's solution meets the DPG Standard, it will be officially considered a digital public good, which will allow the startup to promote the solution as one in line with global standards.  

4. **Brand and media exposure in the startup ecosystem (national, regional and global reach):** Once a solution is recognized as a digital public good, your work as an accelerator and the DPG itself is made visible to a global audience including governments, NGOs, and non-profit organizations. The DPGA is endorsed by the UN Secretary General's Roadmap for Digital Cooperation, and it's DPG Registry aspries to become a global go-to-platform for open source solutions. By nominating a startup solution to become a DPG, it will make your work as an accelerator visible to a broad audience.  

5. **Deployment opportunities:** UNICEF and other DPGA partners are working directly with national governments, UN agencies, and others who are looking for open source solutions to deploy in their countries. As part of the platform, the DPGA includes DPGs in these explorations.

6. **Follow on funding and support for the startup:** The DPGA is developing partnerships with organisations and investors who can provide your solution with the next level of financing and technical assistance.

7. **Mentorship by Tech Companies:** With the DPGA and their member's network of corporate partners, there is potential for collaboration and technical mentorship for the startups.

## What happens after the startup solution gets endorsed as a digital public good by DPGA?
DPGA is constantly adding additional offerings to support vetted DPGs, below is a quick summary of the current and upcoming benefits to be recognized as a digital public good.

**Current:**
* Assessed projects will be informed by the DPGA
* Displayed on the DPGA website 
* Announced through the DPGA’s blog and mailing lists
* The project’s designation will be reflected on connected platforms such as [DIAL’s](https://solutions.dial.community/) Catalog of Digital Solutions where it can easily be discovered by implementers, partners and funders
* Projects are empowered to describe themselves as approved DPGs by the DPGA 
* Projects are encouraged to work with the DPGA to identify other ways for the DPGA to support and amplify the project, brand and mission

**Upcoming:**
* We are working with additional partners to establish visual icons and indicators to increase the discoverability and prominence of DPGs
