# Accelerator Perks of Supporting DPGs

In short, for a startup to create a Digital Public Good opens avenues for primarily scaling a startup, through the follow:

1. **Global Network:** Amongst UNICEF, DPGA, and other partners, we work with startup ecosystems, government agencies and field experts to connect your startups to stakeholders who can potentially support the startup looking to attain DPG status.  This also can include a wider contribution from the IT community which is important for the active open source aspect. The solution will be included in the Alliances recommended packages for governments and UN agencies.  

2. **Access to Experts from Communities of Practice (CoPs):**  In Communities of Practice, the DPGA convene experts from different organizations to align on definitions, processes and to collectively identify, assess and advance critical digital solutions. CoPs are a means of leveraging years of experience from individuals operating in relevant sectors that have gained invaluable insights into implementation processes and development needs, who can collectively accelerate the achievement of the sustainable development goals. The DPGA convenes communities of practice in areas such as climate change adaptation, financial inclusion, and of course, health.

3. **The potential scale and growth of the startup:** These startups can potentially be adapted and solve challenges in other countries, giving it the geographic scale and growth quicker than a proprietary business. If the project meets the DPG Standard, it will be officially considered a Digital Public Good, and will allow the startup to promote the solution as one endorsed in line with global technical standards.  
4. **Branding and media exposure in the startup ecosystem (national, regional and global reach):** As the startup who produces and attains a Digital Public Goods title, the work will be made visible to an audience of global government counterparts, NGOs, and non-profit organizations.   The DPG Alliance and its platform has been endorsed by the UN Secretary General and aims to become the global go-to-platform for open source solutions. Submitting your solution to be published and vetted will make your work visible to a broad audience of governments, NGOs, and non-profit organizations.  Through the startups who attain a DPG status, you can even feature your stories on DPGA channels.
5. **Deployment opportunities:** UNICEF and other Alliance partners are working directly with national governments, UN agencies, and others who are looking for open source solutions to deploy in their countries. As part of the platform, the Alliance can include your startup solutions in these explorations.
6. **Follow on funding and support for the startup:** The Alliance is developing partnerships with organisations and investors who can provide your solution with the next level of financing and technical assistance.
7. **Mentorship by Tech Companies:** With our network of corporate partners as well, there is potential for collaboration and technical mentorship for the startups.
