# You have become a Digital Public Good!  Now, what?

## Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) 
Once a project becomes a DPG and is listed in the registry.  DPGA will promote and announce the project/startup to the DPGA ecosystem through social , newsletter and additional relevant communications (blogs, talks, papers).  Presence in the Registry is also a pre-requisite for being highlighted by a community of practice which is additional exposure.  The DPGA takes note of newly vetted DPGs and make relevant connections where they see them within the ecosystem.  DPGA is currently piloting a “community call” for a subset of DPGs (currently focused on Digital Public Infrastructure, DPIs). 

The DPGA has no direct mechanism to provide funding to individual DPGs. We are working with high-level donors to prioritize funding for vetted DPGs and to create new mechanisms to direct large amounts of money towards DPGs but today funding continues to be through those donors and their specific programs i.e. [Digital Square](https://digitalsquare.org/solicitations)'s open application process.  

## UNICEF Country Office 
Working with the UNICEF’s country office or local UN agencies, there can be potential synergies on public solutions that projects are in need of.  For example, by understanding what the priorities are within each project or programme team in various UN agencies located in that particular country, there could potentially be a fit for a solution within that UN country office OR connections to other local NGOs that would be in need of the DPG.   

## Funding for DPGs 
The UNICEF DPG team is currently working closely with UNICEF Innovation Fund and DPGA to bring together potential investors and give more opportunities to highlight DPGs to the investment community. 

## Next Steps: Newly Registered DPGs
The following are steps that the UNICEF office and DPGA have been working with newly registered DPGs.  

1. A follow up call with the DPGs and UNICEF DPG team to better understand their business goals and guide them through developing a country onboarding process (a presentation deck explaining the use cases of the DPG, adoption requirements, technical assistance available etc).  The DPG should present an update deck with their expansion plans and modalities for scaling.  UNICEF's DPG team will guide teams on how to be technically ready for multi country scale, as well as leveraging the value of being endorsed as a DPG (building and maintaining a community, accessing technical and financial resources).

2. Based on the team's business plans + onboarding process, UNICEF DPG and DPGA will make introductions to specific countries of interest and invite the pathfinder DPG Pool to present in the next all country gathering. 

3. A public update on how pathfinder DPGs are scaling and being adopted in other contexts.
