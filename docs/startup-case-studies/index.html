It bridges women with service providers, knowledge resources, and community support. It collects valuable, anonymous data that can fill the gap of data absence in the fight against VAWG.  <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/stories/virtual-safe-space-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more on their story from their Founder and CEO, Mariam Torosyan, here.</a> </p><p>The Safe YOU web platform provides interested stakeholders content management functions to raise awareness, educate, consult, and empower women through community. It is an informative and engaging space for users, and an inclusive platform for stakeholders to get in touch with users and to manage and refer cases. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="going-open-source">Going Open Source<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#going-open-source" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A symbolic moment was when they decided to make Safe YOU an open source solution. They believe being part of the open source community will lead them to a more collaborative and creative pathway. It was an important step for the team as it brought a new culture and vision to our social enterprise. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="becoming-a-dpg">Becoming a DPG<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#becoming-a-dpg" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Becoming a DPG also means a higher compliance with international standards, another level of security for their users. As their team focuses on development and accelerating their expansion to more countries - and ultimately contributing to the attainment of SDG 5: Gender Equality - with this recognition, they believe they will be able to extend Safe YOU to a growing number of countries by 2030.  </p><p>“The Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) convenes partners from the public, private, and philanthropic sectors to collectively support and strengthen open source solutions that can help address some of the world’s greater issues and maintains the Digital Public Goods Registry (DPG Registry) where Safe YOU is now listed. Being listed in the DPG Registry, which is a one-stop shop for digital public goods, increases ourr discoverability and trustworthiness. We are grateful to the UNICEF team for their guidance throughout our journey on becoming a DPG and beyond.” - Mariam Torosyan, Founder and CEO of IMIN and Safe YOU. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="below-are-notes-taken-from-an-interview-with-mariam-torosyan-founder-and-ceo-of-safe-you">Below are notes taken from an interview with Mariam Torosyan, Founder and CEO of Safe YOU:<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#below-are-notes-taken-from-an-interview-with-mariam-torosyan-founder-and-ceo-of-safe-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="how-was-this-project-get-connected-to-become-a-digital-public-good">How was this project get connected to become a Digital Public Good?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#how-was-this-project-get-connected-to-become-a-digital-public-good" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Safe YOU started through two platforms – One of the platforms was talking about gender based violence through UNFPA and on another as a research project with the World Bank.  After this, there was interest from UNICEF which allowed more conversations to begin with Civil Service Organizations (CSOs).  UNICEF Armenia didn&#x27;t know anything at the time about Digital Public Goods, but they were interested on the subject to fight against Gender-based Violence (GBV).  UNICEF Armenia made a proposal that they wanted to start a project with 11 NGOs on GBV against women. </p><p>UNICEF Armenia and UNICEF HQ then got involved in the project, and then got connected to UNICEF Office of Innovation. Safe YOU was working with UNICEF Armenia to begin a project implementation, with support from UNICEF&#x27;s OOI to become open source and a DPG.  </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="what-stage-of-a-startup-were-you-at-before-unicef-supported-you--did-have-any-prior-traction">What stage of a startup were you at before UNICEF supported you?  Did have any prior traction?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#what-stage-of-a-startup-were-you-at-before-unicef-supported-you--did-have-any-prior-traction" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Before support from UNICEF&#x27;s OOI, they were able to get traction and their solution was needed by UNICEF Armenia during the pandemic.  They were not open source during this time.  Before registering as a LLC (as there is not an entity type of becoming a social enterprise), they knew they wanted to it to be a paid service model.  Mariam spoke with a contact in Georgia to find an organization in need of a solution that Safe YOU provided.  In June 2020, this became their first partnership contract which helped prove the sustainability and profitability of the startup.  After becoming a DPG, the traction has become stronger and scalable. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="were-you-open-source-previously">Were you open source previously?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#were-you-open-source-previously" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>When UNICEF OOI introduced open source, we had to do more research and the whole team then became enthusiastic.  It became a collaborative community to become open source.  When we became open source, we were operating for less than a year.   The partnership model of being open source was providing the technical support to be able to use and integrate the platform, while the mobile application is free for end users. The business model was the same, as they were providing a platform and technical support initially so the organizations can optimize their policies and programmes to tackle GBV against women.  It was a pivotal moment, as there was an internal culture change,within our team and some were worried it was not going to be secure. The philosophy of the platform should be the same as the code which is the ability to be open and beneficial.  </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="dpg-nomination-process">DPG Nomination Process<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#dpg-nomination-process" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>This process helped us become more secure, whether it was to help with securing cyber security and protecting data. This nomination journey s helpful for all projects to become more responsible for what they are creating and how they are creating it.  It took about 2 months to complete the nomination process. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="how-is-your-team-structured">How is your team structured?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#how-is-your-team-structured" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>We currently have a CEO, COO, and technical person and person working with international partners to expand.  Because of the demands coming from organizations on improvements on the platform, we need to be responsive to the needs of local markets.  With the recognition of DPG, it changed their approach to the market and how they can scale.  The DPG Standard is now in the core of our team structure, by asking ourselves what do we want to achieve?  We want to be in as many countries as we can and to have software and data analyses system with AI to help to attain SDG #5 and to help optimize programmes around Gender Based Violence.  There was a lack of tehcnology and innovation previously with iNGOs, NGOs, and Government to understand the real time data and to get access to statistics and with Safe YOU, we can help to optimize the impact these stakeholders are making. </p><blockquote><p>By becoming a DPG, it can become an accelerator itself for going global and recognition that opens a lot of channels to grow quicker.</p></blockquote><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="what-are-the-biggest-challenges-when-you-were-going-open-source">What are the biggest challenges when you were going open source?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#what-are-the-biggest-challenges-when-you-were-going-open-source" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>It was challenging to convince the developers, especially the culture on documentation and publish in a repository, as it required a lot of time and learning from our development team.  Now, they even have to develop openly, and find and manage contributors for the project.   </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="what-was-the-most-helpful-support-you-received-from-unicef">What was the most helpful support you received from UNICEF?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#what-was-the-most-helpful-support-you-received-from-unicef" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>We are now building community to develop the open-source application, and UNICEF has been supporting us on building the developer community, engaging and ensuring we have proper documentation from other users.  While we&#x27;re still early in our open source journey, we&#x27;re learning how to do this. But we know that once we start receiving more contributors and are in the later stage of building the open source product, we will start to benefit from the community of developers who are joining efforts on this project. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="are-you-looking-for-private-investment">Are you looking for private investment?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#are-you-looking-for-private-investment" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>We are currently in the seed investment round (Oct 2021). There are angel investors who are looking to fund Safe YOU.  Private Investment is quite new for the project as it has a lot of challenges around legal and financial questions.  It requires a lot of negotiation with investors, but it is very exciting for Safe YOU.  This private investment will help us prove that Safe YOU is a profitable business model.  These are currently many impact investors interested in social enterprises, and in this investment journey it is important for us to understand our valuation.   In May 2021, we were part of a New York based accelerator for commercial startups, and during this accelerator program we talked to private investors and understood what investors were looking for and how to prepare a startup pitch. </p><p>Currently, Safe YOU is looking for impact investors and those that can help with our expansion strategies. We are also looking to apply for the UNICEF Innovation Fund.  The funding will be used to enhance their AI model and show to other investors that there is interest.  Now we are ready for seed investment because we have revenue and traction – on top of being mission and impact driven enterprise. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="what-are-the-most-enticing-aspects-of-becoming-a-dpg">What are the most enticing aspects of becoming a DPG?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#what-are-the-most-enticing-aspects-of-becoming-a-dpg" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Every time we mention the term &quot;Digital Public Good&quot; to investors or other stakeholders, they ask what this is. We teach the concept and the importance of being a DPG for Safe YOU as an achievement and that DPGs are already incorporated into the agenda of SDG.  Becoming a DPG has been helpful in our  investment journey as it helps position us on a higher probability of market penetration and DPGs are  welcomed in pathfinding countries where UN agencies are familiar with this concept.</p><blockquote><p>If we position it as a DPG recognition, it may not be as important to an investor. If we position it that becoming a DPG has helped with the growth of the business and as a channel going to different markets, the investors become more interested. </p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="accessible-kazakhstan--becoming-a-dpg-supported-by-unicef-and-an-accelerator-astana-hub">Accessible Kazakhstan – Becoming a DPG supported by UNICEF and an Accelerator (Astana Hub)<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#accessible-kazakhstan--becoming-a-dpg-supported-by-unicef-and-an-accelerator-astana-hub" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Accessible Kazakhstan is a crowdsourced map of accessible public spaces, buildings and businesses for people with disabilities.

Accessible Kazakhstan was financed by the European Union. In addition to administrative costs, the project included training for regional representatives (offline and online), developing an online training course (publicly available on the Stepik LMS platform), and distributing smaller size grants to regional representatives to monitor public facilities and make an interactive map via adding the info about the facilities. </p><p>We had several smaller size grants for the translation of educational materials from German into Kazakh and Russian; for conducting a final international conference; for making videos in Kazakh and Russian; for adding the “Accessibility and safety of children under 7” part to the checklist. </p><p>When we received funding from UNICEF, we improved the information system “Accessible Kazakhstan”: design, statistics block, personal account block, etc.; producing two videos, two webinars, an online training course on organizing children&#x27;s zones in public facilities. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="were-you-open-source-previously-1">Were you open source previously?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#were-you-open-source-previously-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>No. Within the framework of the first agreement with UNICEF, only the “Accessibility and safety of children under 7” part was made open source. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="what-convinced-you-to-go-open-source-describe-your-open-source-journey">What convinced you to go open source?
