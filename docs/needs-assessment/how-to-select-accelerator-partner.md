# As a donor or development partner, how do I select an accelerator partner?

These could apply to UN Agencies, NGOs, iNGOs, or other donors who would like to partner with an accelerator.

1. **Before working on DPGs, conduct a brief startup ecosystem mapping.**  It is highly recommended to NOT run a programme on your own, but leverage resources and partners in the existing ecosystem.  List out stakeholders involved with accelerators, incubators, government institutions, startup financiers, universities, startups  – mark them by focus areas such as industry, stage of startup they’re supporting. 

2. **Connect with other development agencies or NGOs to understand what solutions or projects they’re working on.** This can give you a good idea of what potential startups could be connected as a DPG to these NGO projects. UNICEF colleagues around the world are eligible to enroll in appointments with Open Source mentors, with priority to Country Offices.  Anyone associated with UNICEF may request appointments for evaluation and assessment by Open Source mentors. These appointments are scheduled as there is availability. Current wait times for appointments are within 1-2 weeks.  Email the [programme team](https://unicef.github.io/inventory/meta/mentorship/overview/#team) from a UNICEF email address to schedule an appointment. 

3. **Connect with the open source community** -  By identifying the OS groups and developer communities, there could be potential projects that can be identified as a DPG, where you can have accelerators support. 

4. **Identify a shortlist of conscious technology or OS curious & friendly accelerators** – Chat with several accelerators in the country that are focused on conscious technology and shortlist these when you identify projects that could be potentially supported by these accelerators. 

## Approaching an accelerator for support  

1. **Explain that you are identifying high potential, scalable startups that are working on conscious technologies.  Collaboration Points you can use:**

* If the accelerator can identify startups in their portfolio that could potentially apply to UNICEF’s Innovation Fund or nominate as a Digital Public Good.

* As a development partner,  you can help accelerators identify solutions that could be matched with government priorities or other UN Agency projects and potentially implemented or funded.   

2. As a development partner, if there are solutions that you identify are scalable and profitable, see if there’s potentially a collaboration with friendly Accelerators to gain the support of their business network and resources (including those in this guidebook they can readily use). 

* You can use funding for this accelerator to support the startup you’ve identified to potentially go open source and become a DPG – this can include implementation + funding for the startup.
