# What are the steps to support and accelerate DPGs?

If you are convinced to this point of helping build digital solutions to become a Digital Public Good,  here are the next steps to consider before fully supporting DPGs.

Various stages and ways to support startups looking to go open source and becoming a DPG:

* **Stage 1: Awareness of Open Source Business Models and Benefits of DPGs**
* **Stage 2: Identification and Integration Within Your Accelerator**
* **Stage 3: Implementing your own Open Source Accelerator**

## Stage 1: Awareness of DPGs and Open Source Benefits

### 1.  Understand if the startups you support or within your network are wanting to design products for public good and if these startups should be open source. 
If the audience of the cohort or alumni have potential interest on this topic, you can start to host information sessions to gage further interest.  These audiences could include your accelerator cohort, network of community stakeholders such as startups, mentors, experts, academia, or those in your pipeline sourcing.
* Do these startups or audience have products or have interest that it can be for the public good?  Public good can be potentially used for public sector integration.  [See some examples of DPGs here.](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/highlighted-digital-public-goods/).
* _Other:_ Should this startup be open source?
* _Other:_ Does this startup solution align to the government’s strategic priorities? For example, in Kazahkstan the government priorities are tackling digital health solutions digital education skills, digital innovations around economy, child protection and internet safety.

### 2.  Host an initial information session on the following:

#### Open Source Awareness
Many people know what open source is already, but don’t realize the benefits of open source.  This is where you can potentially host a workshop or speaker series on the misconceptions of open source, challenges, and benefits.   You can leverage the section of "Open Source Business Models & Digital Public Goods" in the guide.

#### DPG Awareness
This can be grouped with the Open Source Awareness content.  Content you can use:
* [Why and How to Become a DPG](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AqqiGqjJTBM7DsfIz8szGXU4bL72YXM9/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109395478007960519704&rtpof=true&sd=true) presentation deck  

### 3.  Make your network & community aware of open source and Digital Public Goods
Host a series of webinars on Open Source and Digital Public Goods (still in awareness stage, to get enough leads and interest from startups).
* Engage other friendly startup hubs, accelerators, and private sector companies interested in open source to collaborate on these webinars.

## Stage 2: Identify the startups who are considering taking their businesses open source 
**Support the startups directly through your cohort** using this guide to engage all the stakeholders previously mentioned in thes section "Who is supporting DPGs and how do I engage with them?" and the technical resources to support.  Prepare the startups through your existing accelerator program for open source success (navigate to "Designing & Structuring support for startups in guide).  

1. **Make a list of contacts and engage with government stakeholders and associations** who align with the startup solution you are supporting.
2. **Engage a network of community developers** who could potentially contribute to the open source solution – if there are specific sector hackathons that align with the startup. 
3. Once the startup has enough traction and a working prototype in your program, they can be great candidates for UNICEF’s Innovation Fund cohorts. UNICEF's Venture Fund continues to accept applications on a rolling basis and will review the submissions with the next call. 
4. If they are already obtaining an open source license and are building the community around their product: 
    * Apply for [UNICEF’s Innovation Fund](https://www.unicefinnovationfund.org/home)
    * Nominate them to become a DPG (navigate to Nominate a DPG) 
5. If they are already operating an open source project/product, but do not have an open source license,  navigate to section to get started on “Which open source license should you get?”.  
6. If they are not operating an open source project/product yet, 
    * Here are some [commonly asked questions about DPGs](https://resources.digitalpublicgoods.net/) & going open source 
    * If these questions are not yet answer, you can start to navigate “Setting up for Open Source Success” section to see how you can start to support them or questions they may have throughout the process from going open source (which license or model is right for them?) to becoming a Digital Public Good. 
    * Before considering if they are a DPG, take a look at the [DPG Registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/) to see if there are similar DPG nominations already.

## Stage 3: Implementing your own Open Source Accelerator
### Implementation Stage
Host an accelerator cohort program that has a focus area on going open source.  This can be in alignment with a corporate partner or a national priority.  You can source a corporate or larger entity funding partner for this program and there can be potential for UNICEF’s Country Office or UNICEF’s Office of Innovation to support this if there is applicable funding. 

### Identify the scope of your DPG Accelerator
Starting with the national agenda for digital transformation, your government agency could decide to focus its DPG Accelerator on specific sector(s) of DPGs that could play a major role in strengthening public services such as remote learning content and systems, financial inclusion, employment or digital health applications. The leading government agency could then help guide the acceleration program’s scope and technical assistance strategy to ensure that graduating DPGs meet the local needs and global standards for scalability. Additionally, there may be one or more acceleration or funding opportunities for innovations in the same sectors that could be helpful to align with for synchronized investment and support.

1. Engage with corporate stakeholders to find joint funding and alignment.

2. _**Resource:**_ If the accelerator is collaborating closely with a government counterpart on implementing a startup solution as a pilot, please refer to this [DPGA Country Engagement guide.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Ba7c20gNo6RiaI3yeLme7ZbO-XiOJl0MqhzUPUREKs/edit). 

3. _**Resource:**_ [Concept Note of ING Fintech Cohort in the Philippines:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18rTT0tmQj-6hHjdft3wdfzRbDkwKrVRa/view?usp=sharing) For example, ING partnered with IdeaSpace (Incubator in the Philippines) and UNICEF on the Fintech cohort with the objective of taking these startups to become open source.

### Supporting at various open source stages of a startup - to be added with additional information
Just as an accelerator may have specific focus areas on industries or selection criteria on the stage of the startup.  This guidebook will help support on specific stages of where a startup is at building their open source product, such as:
* Supporting existing businesses looking to go open source 
* Supporting existing open-source businesses 
* Supporting new startups who want to create open source businesses from the start 

#### Expectations
**Where most startups struggle or need support most?**
* Defining an Open Source Strategy and then acting on it
* Legal & Policy issues and concerns
* Practical Advice on how to build a community of people and contributors around their intellectual property
