# UNICEF's Work

## UNICEF Office of Innovation

UNICEF’s Office of Innovation uses technology to address the biggest challenges facing children today. We use technology and new approaches to do three things:
1. **Provide Life-saving Info and Services** - We use new approaches and technologies to increase access to essential services, use scarce resources more efficiently, and communicate life-saving information.  
2. **Engage Young People in Change** - We use technology and new approaches to engage young people around the world, connect them to their governments as well as opportunities to ensure that they are future ready. 
3. **Help UNICEF meet children's needs today and tomorrow** - We identify emerging technologies, conduct research, experiment with new approaches, and invest in early stage solutions. We work to ensure that children can take advantage of technological opportunities and be protected from technological risks. 

_**Partnerships**_
UNICEF works to create new partnership structures that can narrow the gap between technologies (and practices) and the people we need to reach. Our partners apply their expertise, networks, internal platforms and data – not only to delivering viable business strategies, but also to creating long-term value for entire populations, systems and countries. UNICEF Innovation focuses on four types of partnerships: 
1. **Startup companies:** identifying and investing in promising startups working on open-source frontier technology solutions that show potential to positively impact the lives of the most vulnerable children.  This is our primary work done through the UNICEF Innovation Fund.  We are also in collaboration with Startup Accelerators who wish to accelerate Digital Public Goods – more on that in this guide! 
2. **Private sector:** convening corporations (such as Arm, Amadeus, Google, Facebook, Telefonica, IBM, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer), designers, entrepreneurs, and other development partners around the intersection of high-growth tech industries and social good.  
3. **Academic:** bringing shared value through the exchange of ideas, joint capacity building and opportunities for applied research. These relationships are about building up a community of practice and practitioners and connecting with a new generation of problem solvers. 
4. **International agencies and other United Nations entities:** serving as a convening force across the United Nations system and among international organizations, co-creating and implementing solutions and leveraging local and global networks.

## UNICEF's Venture Fund 
UNICEF’s Venture Fund falls under the UNICEF Office of Innovation (OOI). The Venture Fund collaborates with innovators on the ground in UNICEF programme countries to build and test new solutions at the pace required to keep up with the rapidly evolving challenges facing children.  

### _**UNICEF Innovation Fund**_
The UNICEF Innovation Fund quickly assesses, funds, and grows open-source digital public goods that have been developed in new and emerging markets. The Innovation Fund invests exclusively in open source technology solutions. The investments can go either to UNICEF Country Offices or to private sector companies in UNICEF programme countries.   By investing in multiple concurrent teams working on similar problems and technology stacks the Fund can accelerate both the development of products, as well as the building, iteration, and exit of the teams around the technologies. The Fund also invests in early-stage "knowledge products" - operations research that is published in the public domain and supports investment strategies and decisions.  Through its investments, the Innovation Fund is generating value by strengthening communities of problem solvers, increasing the pool of global digital public goods, and growing solutions that bring results for children and the world. 

_**UNICEF Innovation Fund Background**_
The Venture Fund was launched by UNICEF in 2016 – currently (2021) a USD $35M (+2267 ETH + 8BTC) investment fund – applying lessons learned over 8+ years, undertaking the complex work of helping to identify and grow innovations for children. The UNICEF Venture Fund makes USD $50–100K early stage investments in technologies for children developed by UNICEF country offices or companies in UNICEF programme countries. By providing flexible funding to early-stage innovators, it allows UNICEF to quickly assess, fund and grow open-source technology solutions that show potential to positively impact the lives of vulnerable children. To date in Q4 2021, UNICEF has made 113 investments in digital public goods across 67 countries. 

_**Acceleration Fund**_
Starting with making $200 - $400K size grants to startups graduating from UNICEF's Venture Fund, the vision for this vehicle is to eventually issuing guarantees, equity and debt.​

_**CryptoFund**_
A prototype fund that accepts donations and make disbursements in cryptocurrencies (exclusively) to finance early stage, open source technology benefiting society.​​  [More about the UNICEF's CryptoFund found here.](https://cryptofund.unicef.io/) 

_**Objective of the Fund**_
The Objective is to identify and pilot promising frontier technologies to develop scalable platforms that UNICEF can use in a range of applications and country settings. The fund seeks to achieve this by identifying clusters or portfolios of initiatives around emerging technology - so that UNICEF can shape markets, learn from and provoke these technology sectors to benefit children. Such an investment method allows UNICEF to take small risks within particular technology portfolios, and ensure that even if many of the investments fail, the portfolio is a success. 

_**Results to date**_
The Portfolio currently includes 113 investments (Q4 2021), including 33 to startup companies in countries where UNICEF is active. The Fund aims to grow its portfolio by 30 investments every year. In 2018, the Fund selected cohorts of companies working on data science and artificial intelligence, [blockchain](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unicefs-innovation-fund-announces-first-cohort-blockchain-investments-emerging) and XR. These cohorts are working on similar underlying technology stacks and are collaborating across individual products to build platforms that can more easily be brought to scale. The Venture Fund collaborates with other investors, donors and partners to co-invest and facilitate pathways to growth and scale.

## **UNICEF's DPG Team**
This core team sits under UNICEF's Venture Team.  The DPG team liases closely with the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) on the pathfinders.

As a member of the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA), UNICEF’s Office of Innovation is committed to creating a strong ecosystem for digital public goods.  Since 2021, UNICEF's Office of Innovation has led a series of DPG pathfinding pilots across 10 UNICEF Country Offices (The Eastern Caribbean, Ghana, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Niger, Philippines, Republic of Uzbekistan, Republic of Kyrgyzstan, Sierra Leone, and Vietnam). Pathfinding pilots are time-bound initiatives (ending mid-2022), led by DPGA members in direct cooperation with, or with the endorsement of, a relevant government entity to build local capacity for the creation of new DPGs and/or to support the local adaptation or implementation for existing DPGs. Pathfinding pilots are tailored to the needs of a country and/or region and help define use cases, identify needs, inform adaptations, and enable policy frameworks. UNICEF’s pathfinding pilots show leadership in developing, scaling, and investing in DPGs with a commitment to highlight and share these experiences with other countries and the broader DPGA.  Pathfinder countries are heavily supported by UNICEF's Digital Centre of Excellence ICT4D Advisors.
