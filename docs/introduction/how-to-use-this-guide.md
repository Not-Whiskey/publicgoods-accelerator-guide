# How to Use this Guide

This guide is meant to be directive, with a collection of many relevant cases, templates and resources to help accelerate setting up a pipeline of locally developed DPGs that are addressing national priorities and are regionally scalable. It seeks to cover all the crucial steps from scoping the initiative with public and private partners to graduating DPGs providing tools and templates along the way that can be tailored as needed.

## Primarily this guide will cover:

1. **Introduction to DPGs**
  * Why go Open Source? (Myths about Open Source, Benefits, Challenges)
  * What are DPGs?  Why should I care as an accelerator? (Accelerator Perks)
  * What are the benefits for various stakeholders?

2. **Needs Assessment: Engaging with Stakeholders**
Understanding which stakeholders are important to engage with and how do you approach them, initiate and bring value to the conversation with these stakeholders.

3. **How do you support startups who wish to become DPGs (from going open source to DPG status)?**

4. **What support is needed? (tools, templates, resources provided)**
  * Business Mentorship 
  * Open Source Mentorship

5. **How do you support startups at different stages of going open source (how does it vary)?**

6. **Case studies of how accelerators support DPGs**

(November 1, 2021) The guide is a work in progress, and will look to have a more user friendly design and experience for accelerators to answer a pre-survey and group relevant resources accordingly.
