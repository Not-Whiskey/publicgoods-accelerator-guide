# How to Use this Guide

This guide is meant to be directive, with a collection of many relevant cases, templates and resources to help accelerate setting up a pipeline of locally developed DPGs that are addressing national priorities and are regionally scalable. It seeks to cover all the crucial steps from scoping the initiative with public and private partners to graduating DPGs providing tools and templates along the way that can be tailored as needed.  It is a living document meant to be updated through public input as more organizations accelerate DPGs. You can participate in its continued development and suggest changes at https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-accelerator-guide.  If you are new to Github, you can view this [short description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1axBDyG1MK24s9FyxeMcguqFgg1-nCGa1FXWwBMDqfKE/edit?usp=sharing) (1-2 mins read) on how to contribute to the guide, including giving direct feedback and making proposed edits to the text in the guide.

**Primarily this guide will cover:**

### 1. Introduction to DPGs
  * Why go Open Source? (Myths about Open Source, Benefits, Challenges)
  * What are Digital Public Goods (DPGs)?  Why should I care as an accelerator? (Accelerator Perks)
  * What are the benefits for various stakeholders?
  * How are DPGs sustainable business models? (Privately Funded DPG Investment Cases)

### 2. Needs Assessment: Engaging with Stakeholders
Understanding which stakeholders are important to engage with and how do you approach them, initiate and bring value to the conversation with these stakeholders.

### 3. How can you support startups who wish to become DPGs?

### 4. What support is needed? 
  * Tools, templates & resources
  * Business Mentorship 
  * Open Source Mentorship

### 5. Case studies of how accelerators support DPGs and startups that became DPGs

The guide is a work in progress, and will look to have a more user friendly design and experience for accelerators to answer a pre-survey and group relevant resources accordingly.
