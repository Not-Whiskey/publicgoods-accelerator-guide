## Accessible Kazakhstan – Becoming a DPG supported by UNICEF and an Accelerator (Astana Hub) 
Accessible Kazakhstan is a crowdsourced map of accessible public spaces, buildings and businesses for people with disabilities. So far, 4000 places have been mapped across 20 different regions in Kazakhstan. By the end of the year, the map will be endorsed as a DPG ready for scale to new countries and languages. UNICEF DPG team has been supporting Astana Hub to create a pipeline of local DPGs.  UNICEF has been working with Astana Hub to strengthen the alignment between the Hub’s graduates and the UNICEF CO programme priorities. 

### Below are notes taken from an Interview with Alexandra Sharonova Founder and CEO of Accessible Kazakhstan: 

#### What stage of a startup were you at before UNICEF supported you?  
We have had a website, but we were not satisfied with its design and the lack of statistical data on the website. This depended on a lack of funding. 

#### How does Accessible Kazakhstan’s business model operate? 
Initially the project was designed as a social non-profit one. The information and educational components available on our website are free of charge. 

#### What traction or previous funding did you have prior to becoming a DPG? 

The “Accessible Kazakhstan” project is being implemented only with funding from international donors. Accessible Kazakhstan was financed by the European Union. In addition to administrative costs, the project included training for regional representatives (offline and online), developing an online training course (publicly available on the Stepik LMS platform), and distributing smaller size grants to regional representatives to monitor public facilities and make an interactive map via adding the info about the facilities. 

We had several smaller size grants for the translation of educational materials from German into Kazakh and Russian; for conducting a final international conference; for making videos in Kazakh and Russian; for adding the “Accessibility and safety of children under 7” part to the checklist. 

When we received funding from UNICEF, we improved the information system “Accessible Kazakhstan”: design, statistics block, personal account block, etc.; producing two videos, two webinars, an online training course on organizing children's zones in public facilities. 

#### Were you open source previously?  

No. Within the framework of the first agreement with UNICEF, only the “Accessibility and safety of children under 7” part was made open source. 

#### What convinced you to go open source? Describe your open source journey.  

We were offered to improve the information system and make it an open source software. We were interested in such an offer, as we are always open to something new, especially since when it is to help someone and share our knowledge and our products. We agreed immediately. We found programmers, finalized the project, and applied for DPG status. Now we are waiting for the consideration of the DPG application (October 2021). 

#### How is your team structured? 

At the moment, the project manager is Belfer Aleksandra Sergeevna. There are two assistants with disabilities. Since the project functions in all 14 regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan, each region has coordinators (they work in NGOs or with initiative groups, and more than half of them have disabilities). We hire the rest of the specialists if necessary, and we have been cooperating with most of them for several years.  

#### What was the most helpful support you received from UNICEF or Astana Hub?  

Our project manager, Belfer Aleksandra Sergeevna completed a 3-month training at Astana Hub and obtained a lot of new and necessary knowledge that was used in our everyday work. We had daily and close contact with Astana Hub managers who helped to quickly and efficiently resolve any issues that appeared. We had several meetings with UNICEF representatives where we received the necessary assistance for DPG nomination and meeting funding milestones. 

#### Are you looking for private investment?  

Yes, we would like to develop a training course in Kazakh and Russian for government agencies and property owners on how to meet standards of public facilities regarding their accessibility. There is no such course in Kazakhstan, and it is a necessary one. We have plans to use artificial intelligence in the “Accessible Kazakhstan” information system. We would like to open a resource center for voluntary certification and training for accessibility experts. 

#### What are the most enticing aspects of becoming a DPG? 

The most enticing aspect is helping foreign NGOs (for example, in Central Asia) to create a similar product, but using our experience, saving time and financial resources.
