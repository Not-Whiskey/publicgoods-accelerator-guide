Local executive bodies enter into contracts with private companies. It is recommended that a nationwide e-learning platform should be created and or other online platforms needs to be aligned with generally established national and international DPG standards.\nThe mechanism of interaction within the framework of a PPP is time-consuming and an exit strategy must be developed in the event of the end of the PPP\nChildren's online safety\nIn general, there is some degree of control and monitoring of online content, whitelisting and blacklisting at the level of large service providers for 18+ content, however this area is not in the field of view of public stakeholders and NGOs and among others is a less developed area. Requires the development of regulations governing the area of responsibility and regulations\nThere is an urgent need for digital tools to raise awareness about children's safety on the Internet.
